<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Zyda-Commitizen is a customized commitizen tool designed for teams.

Its main purpose is to define a standard way of committing rules and communicating it (using the cli provided by commitizen).

The reasoning behind it is that it is easier to read, and enforces writing descriptive commits.

Besides that, having a convention on your commits makes it possible to parse them and use them for something else, like generating automatically the version or a changelog.
